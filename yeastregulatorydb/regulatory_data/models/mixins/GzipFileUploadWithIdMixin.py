    """
    from copilot: In Python's typing system, a `Protocol` is a way to define an
    interface that a class must adhere to. It's a way to say "any class that
    uses this protocol must have these methods or attributes". In this case,
    `HasPkProtocol` is a protocol that requires a `pk` attribute. The line
    `pk: Optional[int]` is saying that any class that uses this protocol
    must have a `pk` attribute, and that attribute can be an integer or
    `None`. When `GzipFileUploadWithIdMixin` inherits from `HasPkProtocol`,
    it's saying that `GzipFileUploadWithIdMixin` expects to be used with classes that
    have a `pk` attribute. This doesn't enforce anything at runtime, but it
    gives hints to static type checkers like mypy. So, when you use
    `GzipFileUploadWithIdMixin` as a mixin for a Django model, mypy will understand
    that the `pk` attribute is expected to be there, because Django models do
    have a `pk` attribute. This helps to eliminate the error messages you were
    seeing from mypy.
